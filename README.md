# Sandwich Shop Ordering Application

## Description of the Project

This Java console application is designed to streamline the ordering process for a customizable sandwich shop. The application allows users to build a sandwich order by selecting various ingredients, including bread types, toppings, and sauces, and also add drinks and chips. This tool is intended for both customers of a virtual deli and backend administrators who want a seamless way to handle custom orders. The application's purpose is to simplify order management, ensure accurate pricing, and provide a receipt of the final order.

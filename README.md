# Stan Mikita's Subs - Sandwich Ordering Application

## Project Description
![Designer_3.jpg](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2FDesigner_3.jpg)
Stan Mikita's Subs is a Java-based console application that provides a fun, customizable sandwich ordering experience. Inspired by **Wayneâ€™s World** and infused with bold, diverse flavors from **Latin American** and **Asian** cuisine, the app enables customers to create personalized sandwich orders by selecting from a variety of ingredients. Users can choose between different bread types, meats, cheeses, toppings, and sauces, while also adding drinks and chips to complete their meal.

Designed with both the customer and the administrator in mind, Stan Mikita's Subs streamlines the ordering process, provides accurate pricing, and generates a detailed receipt. The application is also designed to accommodate future enhancements, including delivery/pick-up options, nutritional information, discounts, and order history.
